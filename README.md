# ml-deutsche-bahn-delays
UniTartu Machine Learning project "Will my Deutsche Bahn arrive on time?"

# Work environment
We will use a (mini)conda enviroment. For standardization reasons, let this enviroment be named `ml-db-delays`.

To create it (needs to only be done once), run
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

Then, every time that the terminal is used, make sure that `conda` is using the correct enviroment:
```bash
conda activate ml-db-delays
```
