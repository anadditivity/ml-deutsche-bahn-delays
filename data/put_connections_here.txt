Fetch the connections_v2.csv file from either the Google Drive link:

file with correct lines: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14Thc136RbCAJTNRZb8E4BefjlY5v6c43/view?usp=drive_link

older version: https://drive.google.com/file/d/12aPUEuJMe0dgwnHv9mqcKiKAToRq1Hlx/view?usp=sharing

or build it yourself from the file in the repository from the train_line.ipynb file. This might crash your computer as you're creating 15 million lines of CSV.
